# BrontoBase
BrontoBase is a Firebase alternative written in Deno

## Philosophy
BrontoBase is not designed to be scalable, but to be simple and easy. It's here to help beginners get started using Backends as a Service (BaaS) and advanced programmers quickly scaffold
proof of concepts.

We want it to be easy to install, deploy, and use.

## Database
BrontoBase uses an SQLite database. This is by design, to keep things simple.
